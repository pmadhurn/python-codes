Que1. A mechanical product based company wants to buy a machine for the company.
But the company confuse that to buy a old machine or a new machine.
So you have to help company to take a decision to by new or old machine.

A company ready to spend amount on machine per year is given below :

Machine type        Capex(capital expenditure)      Opex(operating expenditure)
Old                 10,00,000                         5,00,000
New                 20,00,000                         3,00,000
TOTAL EXPENSE= Capex+ Opex + 5%(capex)

Capex : A cost spend on machine to service it and buy it per year
Opex : A cost spend to operate a machine.

Company take decision to buy a machine based on the FINAL TOTAL PROFIT calculated for
a machine.

FINAL TOTAL PROFIT= TOTAL EXPENSE â€“ TOTAL PROFIT BY MACHINE

If old machine have more final total profit then company buy old machine otherwise buy new
machine.

TOTAL PROFIT BY MACHINE based on below table:

machine     Income produced by machine(IC)      Profit from income produced

OLD         7,00,000<IC                               15%
            5,00,000<IC<=7,00,000                      7%
            IC<=5,00,000                               2%
NEW         15,00,000<IC                              10%
            9,00,000<IC<=15,00,000                     8%
            IC<=9,00,000                               5%
